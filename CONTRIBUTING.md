Contributing
============

First of all, **thank you** for contributing.

Bugs or feature requests can be posted online on the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/entering/ireflection/issues)
section of the project.

Few rules to ease code reviews and merges:

* You MUST follow the [PSR-1](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/1/) and [PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/2/).
* You MUST run the test suite.
* You MUST write (or update) unit tests.
* You SHOULD write documentation.

To contribute use PR (Pull Requests), please, write [commit messages that make
sense](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html), and [rebase your branch](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Rebasing)
before submitting your PR

May be asked to [squash your commits](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html)
too. This is used to "clean" your Pull Request before merging it, avoiding commits such as `fix tests`, `fix 2`, `fix 3`, etc.

Run test suite
------------

* install composer: curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
* install dependencies: php composer.phar install --dev;
* run tests: vendor/bin/phpunit
